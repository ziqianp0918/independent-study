# Entry 4: Week 4 of learning EarSketch Tutorials 
### (Unit 2 chapter 13 - 16)<br>
Substrings
``myString[startIndex: endIndex]``(startIndex is inclusive) (endIndex is exclusive).<br>
``len()`` give you the length of the string, it  counts the frist element starting from 0 **NOT** 1. 

## Repetition and Contrast
In the Tutorial, it talks about how you can use music repetition to help the listener enjoy the music more. I was like how? But the next sentence explains it. It states that people enjoy music that they have heard before consciously or unconsciously. I was like cool kinda make sense because when a similar music/song plays on the radio I would react to it immediately. Also, this selection taught me a really cool fact that I did not know before and that is when listening to something that has been repeated the brain will try to imagine the next note before it is actually played. I found this to be quite interesting on the part of how the human brain functions, as well as the cool things it does without us noticing. However, now knowing this fact I would probably catch myself doing it.<br>
The Part about the contrast is easy to understand it is just a piece of new sound that you have not heard before and it creates a new interest for the listener. I take it as part of the songs when you first hear it, you were like "ohhhhh thats sounds cool" or something that caught you by surprise in a good way.

## Advanced Transition Techniques

1. Snare Roll: A sequence of repeated snare hits, with increasing density, pitch, or amplitude. Prevalent in electronic music. 
2. Looping: Repeating a short segment of melody before a new section. Often used when DJing.
3. Crossfading: Decreasing the volume of one section while increasing the volume of a new section. Often you will hear this being done by DJs Where they use it to transition into a new song. In EarSketch you would use two ``setEffect()`` envelopes to do this: one decreases the volume of one track, while the other simultaneously increases the volume of a second track.
4. Anacrusis: An anacrusis is a series of notes that lead into the first beat of a new section. This means that the melody of the new section effectively 
starts a couple beats early.

---
There is a selection where it teaches you about Script Headers. They are like a heading, a small intro, that provides some basic information about the code you have written. Note: they are not comments but a group of comments.<br>
In the Script Headers you **must** include the _language_, _script name_, _author_, and _description_.<br>
- Language of the code the script/code is written in.
- Script name is like a title for the script you have written (song name something like that).
- Author: your name or your group name.
- Description: tell the user what does your code do and how does it do it.


## Takeways
1. Error in code: How to find them *Fast*. While writing code often I see an error and sometimes the error message solves the problem for you. However, many time I found it does not help much besides telling me the error is happening on this certain line of code. Here are some tips to help.
Look for things like Misspelling, Case sensitivity, Parentheses, Initializing variables names, Script setup (**For EarSketch user** (``from earsketch import *``, ``init()``, ``setTempo()``, or ``finish()`` )), Comments, Colons, equality, Indentation, Quotations, Function definitions and calling ,Parameter, argument, Indices, Punctuation.
2. Write Concise code with good comments so when other people use them they can understand what each line of code is doing.
