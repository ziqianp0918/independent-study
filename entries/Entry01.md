# Entry 1: Intro to my independent-study
My teacher gave us rest of the school year to do independent study where we can pick whatever topic we wanted to study.For the first week I spent my time 
looking at all of the topic that might interest me. After a whole week of researching and trying topics. I have narrow it down to the last 
two topics. Which is gosu, a 2D game development library for ruby or EarSketch which user can make music using code.

## What I have learned so far
I have spent the pass 3 class day working on how to get gosu to work in c9. So far I have not got it completely to work with c9, following the documentation 
for gosu I have been able to download home brew on to my project. But more problem arrives when I try to work on it at home, due to the fact that 
Homebrew is made for macOS and I have a window at home it keeps giving me errors. This result in a harder time to transfrom the progress I have made in class 
back at home. I have found a possible way out of this problem, there is a program called linuxbrew which can work on windows but I don't know if I can downlaod 
linuxbrew and Homebrew on the same machine and it would work together or perhaps it can cause the whole program to fail.
